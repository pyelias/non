each frame has 1 bit for if it's available
each 4-frame group has 2 bits for the largest available order of sub-page (0, 1, 2, 4)
each 16-frame group has 3 bits (or 4?) for the largest sub-page (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
and so on

max group size = number of frames / 16 i guess

largest possible sub-page order is 16384 pages, any more won't fit in the bitmap

n = frame count
total usage = 1 * n + 2 * n/4 + 3or4 * n/16 + 4 * n/64 + ...
less than 2n bits, probably

to get a frame of some order
find a top level group with an available sub-frame of that order
look at the groups in it, and find with with that order available
recurse until found
update parent group avail info

groups are an allocator-internal bookkeeping construct
groups have a size: 0, 1, 2, ... represents 1 frame, 4 frames, 16 frames, ...

pages are returned from the allocator
pages have an order: 0, 1, 2, ... represents 1 frame, 2 frames, 4 frames, ...
